# Assignment Description
The objective of this exercise is to design a login screen for a user. You are required to implement user account management as swing app. We have the following use cases to consider:

1) Manage persons use case
This enables a user to create a list of persons: a) add a person; b) list persons; c) search for person by neu id.
2) Managing User accounts use case (administrator)
This enables a user to search for a person using their neu id and create user account based on the person profile found. Your app must enable the system administrator to reset/update user login name and/or user password. All passwords must be saved as hashes (you need to learn how hashing techniques work). The admin will have the ability to disable a userâ€™s account which will block users from login-in to the system regardless of their login credentials.
3)  To test you swing app, allow a user to login to a landing page that shows the user personal information and includes the ability to update their personal information and password. However, if a user decides to update their password, your app must block them from using a previously used password.
